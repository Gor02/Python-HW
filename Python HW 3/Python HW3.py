# Problem 1

# Construct a Dictionary cities_AM that corresponds to largest 5 Armenian cities their population, say, for Yerevan,
# the population is 1077.6 (in thousands).

# cities_AM = {"Yerevan": 1077.6,
             # "Vagharshapat": 46.4,
             # "Kapan": 42.5,
             # "Vanadzor": 79.3,
             # "Gyumri": 114.5
# }

# Print the names of cities

# for i in cities_AM:
    # print(i)

# Print the sum of population in largest 5 Armenian cities

# s = 0
# for i in cities_AM.values():
    # s += i
# print(s)

# Get the name of the second largest (by population) city in Armenia (not by a hand, of course ‚ò∫)

# l = []
# for i in cities_AM.values():
    # l.append(i)
# for j in range(len(l)):
    # for k in range(len(l)):
        # if l[j] > l[k]:
            # l[j], l[k] = l[k], l[j]
# for i in cities_AM:
    # if cities_AM[i] == l[1]:
        # print(i)

# Add the 6th city with its population to the dictionary

# cities_AM["Hrazdan"] = 40.4

# Find information about the surface areas of cities, and update dictionary to include tuples (population, area) for
# each city.

# area = [223, 40, 36, 32, 54, 152]
# key = [i for i in cities_AM.keys()]
# cities_AM.update({key[i]: (cities_AM[key[i]], area[i]) for i in range(len(cities_AM))})

#Construct a similar dictionary cities_GE for Germany 2 largest cities, and create a new Dictionary,
# with keys "Armenia", "Germany", and values as the constructed dictionaries

# cities_GE = {"Berlin": 3.275,
             # "Hamburg": 1.686

# Problem 2

# Consider the list x = [1, -2, 3, 9, 0, 1, 3, 2, -2, -4, 1, -3] . Construct two lists, x_neg and x_pos containng,
# correspondingly, all negative and all positive elements of x in the same order.
# Construct also lists ind_neg and ind_pos which will contain the indices of all negative and positive elements of x,
# respectively.

# x = [1, -2, 3, 9, 0, 1, 3, 2, -2, -4, 1, -3]

# x_neg = [i for i in x if i < 0]

# Given a list of real numbers, find the maximum element of that list, without using any built-in Python max function

# Given a list of arbitrary reals, write a sorting algorithm to sort the list in the increasing order,

# bubble sort or any other well-known algorithm, or just write a simple (maybe non-effective) algorithm.

        # return 4

# Write a function of natural variable  ùëõ  that will return the  ùëõ -the Fibonacci number
